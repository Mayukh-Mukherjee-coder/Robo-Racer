# Robo-Racer bot

The Robo Race bot, created by students of the RoboTech Club at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, was built to participate in techfest competitions. The project aimed to enhance understanding of DPDT switches, AC to DC converters for maintaining 12V in the circuit, and the functioning of a wired car instead of a wireless one.

# Time Line

- Start of Project - 14 January 2025
- Participation in NIRMAN 4th Edition in Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar - 6 February 2025

# Race Track : Rules and Scoring

The race track will feature various obstacles and surprise elements, each requiring the bot to complete a specific task. If the bot successfully completes a task, full points are awarded; if not, no points are given. Teams may skip obstacles, but doing so incurs a point deduction. Additionally, if a team touches their bot to reposition it on the track, a time penalty is applied. Two bots will compete simultaneously, and their completion times will be recorded. The bot that finishes the track in the shortest time wins the competition.

# Conceptual Framework for Wired Bot Control 

The bot is designed to operate using two DPDT switches for control and a wired connection for navigation. It utilizes an AC power supply, which is converted to DC using an AC-to-DC converter to ensure maximum efficiency for the motors.

# Equipments Used

- 10 m long Copper Wire
- AC-DC Converter
- Acylic Used to make Chassis
- Cardbord Box for placing the switch
- DPDT Switches ×2
- Glue gun, Soldering iron, Double Tapes and Tapes
- Motor Wheels ×4
- TT Motors ×4
- Waterproof Tape

# System Architecture

At the beginning, the bot is equipped with two front motors and two rear motors. The two left motors are connected to one switch, while the two right motors are connected to another. The chassis is fully enclosed, with a single exit point for all wiring. These wires lead to the control box, where two DPDT switches are connected to the bot before finally linking to the AC-DC converter.


# Mechanical Design

The 2D design is created in Onshape, and a laser cutter is used to produce a precise acrylic design. Double-sided tape secures the motors, and a glue gun is used for additional stability. All wiring is firmly attached to the base of the acrylic with double-sided tape. The bot is then fully enclosed in acrylic, secured with a glue gun, and finally wrapped in waterproof tape to protect the wiring and connections during the race.
